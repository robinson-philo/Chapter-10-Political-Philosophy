      wherever there is to be a STATE. Legitimacy is needed:<o:p>
      
      </o:p>
      </span></p>
      <p class="" style="
"><span style="
">1.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      </span>For the existence of the state itself  <o:p>
      </o:p>

      </span>For the present office holders &nbsp;<o:p>
      
      </o:p>
      </span></p>
      <p class="" style="
"><span style="
">So, first there needs to be a theory that provides for the reasons
      that there needs to be a government at all.<span style="">&nbsp;
      </span>Several of those theories will be offered below.<span style="">&nbsp;
      </span>Next, there needs to be a legitimization for the particular type of
      government, be it democracy, republic, monarchy, etc... Finally, whatever
      the type of government, the current holders of its various offices must be
      legitimized.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For example, if
      the government is a monarchy then the current head of government (king,
      queen, baron, pharaoh…) must provide evidence that the office holder is
      the proper heir to the throne or position of power due to birth.<span style="">&nbsp;
      </span>Thus evidence of lineage is important.<span style="">&nbsp;
      </span>If the government is a democracy then the current holders of
      offices must demonstrate that they secured the sufficient number of votes
      in the election to merit holding office.<o:p>

      the Divine Being.<span style="

      be the king.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When the king
      dies, his heir is to be ruler.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If
      the kingdom is overthrown and some other person takes power then after
      some time it may be believed that such a person must deserve to rule
      because God must have given approval or else God would not have permitted
      that person to overthrow the previous ruler.<span style="">&nbsp;

      their necessities required, the Lion undertook to distribute the prey, and
      for this purpose divided it into three shares.’ I will take the first

      <p class="" style="
"><i>Although both Hobbes and Rousseau 
      theorize that we should use a social 
      contract model for government, there are some key 
      differences as to why we 
      should use this model and who should be in charge.&nbsp; The 
      first difference is 
      that with Hobbes, people are seen to be inherently at odds 
      with one 
      another.&nbsp; Hobbes asserts that matters are only black and 
      white: there is 
      either anarchy or absolutism.&nbsp; Since people only tend to 
      look out for their 
      own interests and behave in an egoist manner, they must 
      either keep their 
      freedom and deal with the consequence of every man doing 
      for himself or 
      they must surrender power and be led by one ruler who looks 
      out for the 
      best interest of the Commonwealth.&nbsp; I would venture to say 
      that even this 
      ruler is egoistical as what is good for him is what is good 
      for the 
      commonwealth. He remains in power only if the people 
      surrendering power to 
      him are happy.&nbsp; For Hobbes, people must give up their 
      freedoms in order to 
      protect themselves and serve their best interest.&nbsp; For 
      instance, if humans 
      chose anarchy, there would be no laws regarding murder.&nbsp; 
      Everyone would be 
      a potential victim.&nbsp; So, in order for the egoists to ensure 
      that their 
      safety from murder is at least somewhat ensured, they 
      surrender power to 
      the Commonwealth.&nbsp; Rousseau, on the other hand, advocates 
      that people 
      voluntarily give up their freedoms for the good of the 
      whole.&nbsp; Where Hobbes 
      can be seen as an egoist, Rousseau can be seen as a 
      Utilitarian.&nbsp; Rousseau 
      believes that the general will of the majority.&nbsp; According 
      to Rousseau, 
      this ?surrender of each to the good of the whole must take 
      place in a way 
      that also secures the unity of all in a desire for what 
      will most benefit 
      the whole.?&nbsp; Rousseau is attempting to maximize utility.&nbsp; 
      He theorizes that 
      everyone should think of the whole of society and do what 
      is best for 
      society at large, regardless of the consequences or results 
      for the 
      individual.&nbsp; It is this general will that Rousseau believes 
      is the best 
      thing for citizens of the State to abide by.&nbsp; Unlike 
      Hobbes, for whom 
      government exists to control all members of the society, 
      for Rousseau, the 
      government's responsibility is to pass and enforce 
      legislation that fits 
      into the general will of the population.&nbsp; Additionally, in 
      his text 
      Leviathan, Hobbes advocates for a linear monarchy.&nbsp; For 
      Hobbes, the 
      decisions made by the sovereign are completely arbitrary, 
      so long as the 
      people follow the decision the reasoning behind it does not 
      matter.&nbsp; He 
      argues that a monarchy by heredity works best for governing 
      purposes as 
      there is no threat of competition from within society.&nbsp; For 
      Rousseau, 
      monarchy is not an acceptable form of government as the 
      good of all can be 
      easily sacrificed by a monarch with self interest.&nbsp; Instead 
      of a monarchy 
      that is constant and stable, Rousseau advocates a 
      government that is best 
      suited to the needs of the citizens.&nbsp; For Rousseau, the 
      leaders are 
      temporary.&nbsp; The citizens entering into the contract are 
      free to constantly 
      review the leaders and replace them when it seems fit for 
      the good of the 
      whole.&nbsp; Rousseau advocates that leadership positions in 
      which talents and 
      skills are needed should be elected by the majority.&nbsp;

      writings anonymously. With the <i>Two Treatises of Civil Government</i>
      (1690) Locke established himself as a political theorist of the highest
      order. The <i>First Treatise</i> is a detailed refutation of the
      (now-forgotten) monarchist theories of Robert Filmer, but the

2nd treatise on government </a><span style=""> offers a systematic account of the foundations of political obligation. On
      Locke's view, all rights begin in the individual property interest created
      by an investment of labor. The social structure or commonwealth, then,
      depends for its formation and maintenance on the express consent of those
      who are governed by its political powers. Majority rule thus becomes the
      cornerstone of all political order, and dissatisfied citizens reserve a
      lasting right to revolution. Similarly, Locke's </span><i><span style="

      (1689) argued for a broad (though not limitless) acceptance of alternative

      John Hospers, Ph.D., was an early leader in the libertarian movement. He 
      was the
      <a href="http://www.boogieonline.com/revolution/by_name/L/LPUS.html">
      Libertarian Party's</a> first presidential candidate in 1972, and at the 
      time headed the University of Southern California's philosophy department. 
      His book Libertarianism was one of three books defining early libertarian 
      philosophy, the other two being
      <a href="http://www.boogieonline.com/revolution/by_name/R/MurrayRothbard.html">
      Rothbard's</a> Libertarian Manifesto and
      <a href="http://www.boogieonline.com/revolution/by_name/N/RobertNozick.html">
      Nozick's</a> Anarchy, State and Utopia.&nbsp; He is Professor Emeritus in 
      Philosophy at the University of Southern California and author of such 
      important philosophical texts as: Meaning and Truth in the Arts, Human 
      Conduct, and An Introduction to Philosophical Analysis. His numerous 
      philosophical essays are well known for their clear and careful style. As 
      editor of The Personalist, John Hospers opened the pages of that highly 
      respected philosophy journal to a generation of young thinkers interested 
      in basic questions of liberty. He also authored a now classic statement on 
      behalf of liberty in his work, Libertarianism. In 1972, John Hospers 
      served as the first Libertarian Party candidate for President. He has 
      served from then until now as a reference point and inspiration for

      on&nbsp;&nbsp;  <b><i>&nbsp;The Libertarian Theory of Government</i></b></p>
    <p class="" style="line-height:200%">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Libertarianism is 
    the most diplomatic and open-minded political philosophy in the world.&nbsp; The 
    application of the concept of non-coercion is crucial to the libertarian 
    theory of government.&nbsp; Libertarians are passionate opponents of physical 
    coercion because as they are promoters of freedom.&nbsp; They see aggressive and 
    coercive force as a threat to libertarian principles of freedom.&nbsp; The 
    initiation of forceful action is considered to be immoral, especially where 
    government is concerned.&nbsp; The use of force, if permissible by a regime, is 
    deemed to be an infringement upon an individual’s right to life, liberty, 
    property, self-governance or belief.&nbsp; Therefore, the libertarian notion of 
    non-coercion adamantly sets restrictions on governmental authority in order 
    to ensure that certain unalienable rights which uphold autonomous principles 
    are not violated.  </p>
    <p class="" style="line-height:200%">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although 
    libertarians oppose the initial use of force, the act of exercising force 
    first, there are two types of force that are urged with the aim of upholding 
    one’s personal and property rights.&nbsp; Defensive force is acted upon when 
    one’s rights are threatened.&nbsp; It is then that an individual uses force to 
    defend himself and his safety.&nbsp; The government, in turn, should also execute 
    the power to protect individuals by means of defensive force.&nbsp; When one’s 
    own survival is imperiled, then the choice to forcibly defend one’s self is 
    a valid and anticipated option.&nbsp; Retaliatory force is a form of retribution 
    against those who initiated force upon an individual.&nbsp; The judicial systems 
    of most states are sanctioned to penalize those who initiated the force.&nbsp; 
    Whereas coercion and aggression are condemned by libertarians, force that 
    safeguards the survival and justice of individuals is welcomed into 
    non-coercive policy.</p>
    <p class="" style="line-height:200%">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Libertarians 
    embrace the idea of minimal governmental intervention.&nbsp; They regard a 
    government that governs least to be one that governs best.&nbsp; Libertarians 
    constantly strive to debilitate the role of government in society.&nbsp; 
    Governments should solely absorb themselves with the moral foundation of 
    preserving and safeguarding individuals’ rights and with the interdiction of 
    forceful action.&nbsp; Yet, the truth of the matter is that governmental 
    administrators permit the initiation of force in order to attain political 
    and authoritative recognition from the people.&nbsp; Government is occasionally 
    understood to be an institution of forceful control and that is why 
    libertarians attempt to suppress its authority.&nbsp; Libertarians argue that the 
    government does not possess some special type of supernatural entitlement 
    that justifies the violation of its citizens’ rights.&nbsp; In a free society, 
    the government purely functions to defend and retaliate against those who 
    instigate and use force.&nbsp; As we can see, libertarians agree with force that 
    is executed for defensive and retaliatory purposes against those who 
    initiate the force.&nbsp; By no means, however, should the government be the 
    initiator of force.</p>
    <p class="" style="line-height:200%">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the whole, 
    libertarians assert that mutual consent and agreement are peaceful and 
    diplomatic means in which people should opt to deal with each other.&nbsp; The 
    following aspects of freedom roughly encapsulate libertarian doctrine:&nbsp;

      <p class="" style="line-height:200%">Omonia Vinieris (QCC, 2002) 
      on<b><i>&nbsp;&nbsp; Marxist Theory of Government</i></b></p>
    <p class="" style="line-height:200%">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Karl Marx’s theory 
    of government is best expressed in his book the <i>Communist Manifesto</i>.&nbsp; 
    In this book, Marx explains the goals of communism, an evolutionary form of 
    its socialist origin.&nbsp; The law and the state arise out of the development of 
    classes at odds with each other throughout the course of history.&nbsp; 
    Ultimately, socialism will triumph as class conflict comes to an end.&nbsp; In 
    its demise comes along the elimination of private property.&nbsp; At this point 
    there will be no need for law or the state as history will remain in a 
    seamless state of stillness. &nbsp;</p>
    <p class="" style="text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%">
    Class 
    conflict initially arises from the emergence of property.&nbsp; As each class 
    strives to acquire property, in the ends one eventually overpowers and 
    exploits the other in its struggle.&nbsp; Thus, Marx explains that class 
    struggles are inherently anchored in the manipulation of one class by 
    another.&nbsp; Historical progression throughout the ages is the immediate 
    outcome of class struggle. &nbsp;At this point in time, we are in the capitalist 
    stage of history.&nbsp; Capitalism is an economic system in which individuals or 
    corporations privately own the means of production.&nbsp; This concept of private 
    property is what distinguishes this capitalist phase of history from past 
    eras.&nbsp; However, these relationships between the classes will cease to be 
    congruent as the developing means of production give rise to an imbalance. 
    &nbsp;At this point, a revolution transpires and a new dominant class 
    materializes. &nbsp;</p>
    <p class="" style="text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%">
    Marx explains 
    that capitalism is the most decisive stage of historical progression because 
    it is in its imminent future that socialism will triumph and all classes 
    will expire from existence.&nbsp; In socialist theory private property is subject 
    to collective control of the state.&nbsp; Class struggle is the driving force 
    behind the sequence of a capitalist shift to socialism.&nbsp; As soon as the 
    conflict between the classes comes to an end, history itself will come to a 
    standstill and perfect bliss will pervade the earth in its socialist state. 
    &nbsp;The classes in discord in the present capitalist stage of history are of 
    two sorts: the property owners who do not work (bourgeoisie), and the 
    property-less workers (proletariat).&nbsp; The proletariat will eventually revolt 
    as the relationship between the two classes fails because capitalism proves 
    to be erratic and unsteady.&nbsp; In due course this revolution will beget the 
    take-over of socialism.&nbsp; Private property will then be demolished by the 
    proletariat.&nbsp; Thus it is acquisition of property that renders the divergent 
    nature of the classes.&nbsp; Socialism would implicate utopian means of 
    production.&nbsp; The law and the state will serve no purpose in a socialist 
    state because order and equality will prevail.</p>
    <p class="" style="text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%">
    Philosophically speaking, Marxism falls into the branch of empiricism called 
    dialectal materialism.&nbsp; This philosophy’s focal point is on the senses which 
    recognize peripheral actuality exclusive of emotional intervention.&nbsp; Hegel, 
    Marx’s collaborator, helped to define the dialectic aspect of materialist 
    philosophy in that ideas are always in motion or in a constant state of 
    change.&nbsp; Change is the continual clash between ideas as we see in struggling 
    classes of history.&nbsp; The emergence of a first thesis conflicts with the 
    emergence of an antithesis.&nbsp; From these opposing ideas springs a resolution 
    called a synthesis.&nbsp; This process repeats itself until one day a final 
    synthesis subdues the two conflicting ideas (socialism).&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

">According to this approach a government deserves to hold and
      exercise power as long as it provides for justice.<span style="
yes">&nbsp; </span>If it does not do so then it should be altered or overturned
      for a government that does provide for justice.<span style="">&nbsp;
      </span>No Justice, No Peace.&nbsp;<o:p>

      <p class="" style="

">What does Justice mean?</span></p>
      <p class="" style="
"><span style="
">Plato’s theory of justice involved the idea
      of the harmony of all parts.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When
      all parts of society are working as they are supposed to do, when they are
      fulfilling their purpose then there shall be justice in the state.<o:p>

      </o:p>

      <p class="" style="

      <p class="" style="

"><i><span style="
">Plato asserts that functional specialization
      demands from every social class to specialize itself in the station of
      life allotted to it. Justice, therefore to Plato is like a manuscript that
      exists in two copies, and one of these is larger than the other. It exists
      both in the individual and the society. But it exists on a larger scale
      and in more visible form in the society. Individually &quot;justice is a
      'human virtue' that makes a man self consistent and good: Socially,
      justice is a social consciousness that makes a society internally
      harmonious and good.&quot;<o:p> 
      </o:p>
      </span></i></p>
      <p class="" style="

"><i><span style="
">Justice is thus a sort of specialization. It is
      simply the will to fulfill the duties of one's station and not to meddle
      with the duties of another station, and its habitation is, therefore, in
      the mind of every citizen who does his duties in his appointed place. It
      is the original principle, laid down at the foundation of the State,
      &quot;that one man should practice one thing only and that the thing to
      which his nature was best adopted&quot;. True justice to Plato, therefore,
      consists in the principle of non-interference. Plato as a perfect has
      considered the State whole in which each individual which is its element,
      functions not for itself but for the health of the whole. Every element
      fulfils its appropriate function. Justice in the platonic state would,
      therefore, be like that harmony of relationship where the Planets are held
      together in the orderly movement. Plato was convinced that a society that
      is so organized is fit for survival. Where men are out of their natural
      places, there the co-ordination of parts is destroyed, the society
      disintegrates and dissolves. Justice, therefore, is the citizen sense of
      duties.<o:p>

      <p class="" style="

">Liberal (<b><a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Rawls">John Rawls</a></b>)&nbsp;<o:p>
      
      </o:p>
      </span></p>
      <p class="" style="
"><span style="
">The function of the STATE is to provide Justice as fairness, an
      arrangement of institutions whereby maximal liberty consistent with equal
      opportunity and a principle to benefit the worst off is the central
      principle. (The Maxi Min Principle)&nbsp;<o:p>
      
      </o:p>
      </span></p>
      <p class="" style="
">Some criticize Rawls' notion of 
      justice for requiring that the least well off be cared for and made better 
      and that the view of the least well off is a relative notion or judgment 
      of their situation and not an absolute judgment.</p>
      <p class="" style="
">Illustration:</p>
      <p class="" style="
">Let's say that there are 10 people.
      Their income ranges from $1,000,000 to $50,000 per year.
      The average income is $150,000.<br>
      <br>
      Why should we care about the least well off ($50,000) in the group 
      relative to the others and even least well off compared to the average if 
      that person is making $50,000/year in a society where $50,000 provides for 
      a very comfortable life?<br>
      <br>
      Relative to the average the $50,000 person is negative or down $100,000 
      from the average. But still the $50G might be pretty good in an absolute 
      sense that it provides well for all the basics of life.<br>
      <br>
      Now you can substitute for the annual income:<br>
      physical abilities<br>
      type of residence<br>
      ability to think, do math, speak foreign languages, make music, paint , 
      etc...<br>
      <br>
      Why would justice always require taking care to improve the position of 
      the least well off-relative to the others?<br>

">So there are a variety of theories on government.<span style="">&nbsp;
      </span>There are a variety of Political Philosophies.<span style="">&nbsp;
      </span>Each offers it view on how it is that government is to hold and
      exercise power over individuals.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Each
      operates within a more general view of how it is that society ought to be
      regulated.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Ach has what Plato
      would term an “Ideal Model”.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>According
      to that model government acts.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One
      of the ways in which governments must act is to resolve the conflicts that
      arise in every society between the interests that individuals have in
      their own welfare and happiness and the interest that the group as a whole
      has in its welfare.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This will
